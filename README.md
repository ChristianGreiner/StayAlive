# StayAlive

Stay Alive is a single-player, round based Oculus VR game written in C# and Unity game engine. The main goal of this game is to stay alive as long as possible. During the game, the player stands in the middle of the graveyard (map) while zombies randomly spawn and rush towards him.

The player can use two weapons, a pistol and a RPG. Once enough zombies are killed, a new round begins with more zombies that differ in size and running speed.
